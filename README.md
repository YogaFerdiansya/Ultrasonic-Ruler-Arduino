# Ultrasonic-Ruler-Arduino
This project demonstrates how to create a digital ruler using an ultrasonic sensor and an OLED display with an Arduino. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to an object, and the OLED display shows the measurement in real-time. Perfect for DIY enthusiasts and makers looking to explore sensor integration and display technologies with Arduino.
